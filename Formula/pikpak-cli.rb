  # Homebrew rejects any flag a formula did not declare and an option name is
  # fixed at load time, so the code itself has to become part of the declared
  # name -- hence reading the command line here. Plain `PIKPAK_AFFILIATE` is
  # not usable: `brew` drops environment variables without a `HOMEBREW_`
  # prefix before a formula ever runs. `brew style` objects to both lines
  # below; they are homebrew/core policy (no `option`, no `ARGV`) and core
  # has no way to express a flag that carries a value.

      Homebrew manages this `pikpak`, so upgrade with `brew upgrade pikpak-cli`.
      `pikpak update` still swaps the Cellar binary behind Homebrew's back and
      leaves the keg out of sync; `brew reinstall pikpak-cli` restores it.

      To teach a local AI coding agent the pikpak commands:
        pikpak skill install
    CAVEATS
    notes << record_affiliate_code
    notes.compact.join("\n\n")
